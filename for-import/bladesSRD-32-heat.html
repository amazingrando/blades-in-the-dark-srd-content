<h1>Heat</h1>
<p>The city is full of prying eyes and informants. Anything you do might be witnessed, and there’s always evidence left behind. To reflect this, your crew acquires <span class="game-term">heat</span> as they commit crimes. After a score or conflict with an opponent, your crew takes <span class="game-term">heat</span> according to the nature of the operation:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">0 heat:</span> Smooth &amp; quiet; low exposure.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">2 heat:</span> Contained; standard exposure.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">4 heat: </span>Loud &amp; chaotic; high exposure.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">6 heat:</span> Wild; devastating exposure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> for a high-profile or well-connected target. Add +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> if the situation happened on hostile turf. Add +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> if you’re at war with another faction. Add +2 <span class="game-term">heat</span> if killing was involved (whether the crew did the killing or not—bodies draw attention).</p>
<p>You mark <span class="game-term">heat</span> levels on the <span class="game-term">heat</span> tracker on the crew sheet.</p>
<p>@TODO add table p91</p>
<p>When your <span class="game-term">heat</span> level reaches 9, you gain a <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> and clear your <span class="game-term">heat</span> (any excess <span class="game-term">heat</span> “rolls over,” so if your <span class="game-term">heat</span> was 7 and you took 4 <span class="game-term">heat</span>, you’d reset with 2 <span class="game-term">heat</span> marked).</p>
<p>The higher your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>, the more serious the response when law enforcement takes action against you (they’ll send a force of higher <strong>quality</strong> and <strong>scale</strong>).</p>
<p>Also, your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> contributes to the severity of the <strong>entanglements</strong> that your crew faces after a score. See page <a>94</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="incarceration">Incarceration</h2>
<p>The only way to reduce your crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> is through incarceration. When one of your crew members, friends, contacts—or a framed enemy—is convicted and incarcerated for crimes associated with your crew, your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> is reduced by 1 and you clear your <span class="game-term">heat</span>.</p>
<p>Incarceration may result from investigation and arrest by the officers, or because someone turns themselves in and takes the fall for the crew’s crimes.</p>
<p>The severity of the prison sentence depends on your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Wanted Level 4: </span>Life or execution.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Wanted Level 3:</span> A year or two.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Wanted Level 2:</span> Several months.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Wanted Level 1:</span> A month or two.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Wanted Level 0:</span> A few weeks. Or, the constables give you a beating to teach you a lesson (suffer level 3 harm, no resistance roll allowed—they keep going until you’re injured).</li>
</ul>
<p>Incarceration is dehumanizing and brutal. The renown of your crew is your only real defense inside. When you serve your time, make an <strong>incarceration roll</strong> using your crew’s Tier as the dice pool.</p>

<h2 id="prison-claims">Prison claims</h2>
<p>@TODO add table p93</p>
<h3 id="allied-claim">Allied claim</h3>
<p>One of your allies on the inside arranges for their faction to grant you a boon. Take a claim for your crew from a different crew type. You can’t take turf with this claim.</p>
<h3 id="cell-block-control">Cell block control</h3>
<p>Your crew has a cell block under their total control—guards and all. You never take <span class="game-term">trauma</span> from incarceration.</p>
<h3 id="guard-payoff">Guard payoff</h3>
<p>You claim several prison guards on your payroll. Take +1d to your Tier roll when a member of your crew is incarcerated.</p>
<h3 id="hardcase">Hardcase</h3>
<p>Your reputation as a tough inmate bolsters your crew’s image. When your crew advances Tier, it costs 2 fewer <span class="game-term">coins</span> than it normally would.</p>
<h3 id="parole-influence">Parole influence</h3>
<p>Political pressures of various sorts can be applied to the magistrates and warden who oversee sentences for crimes. With this claim, you’re always able to arrange for a shorter prison stay—as if your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> was 1 lower. So, if your <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> was 3 when you went in, you’d spend only several months behind bars (equivalent to level 2) instead of a full year.</p>
<h3 id="smuggling">Smuggling</h3>
<p>You arrange smuggling channels inside. You have <strong>+</strong>2 load** while incarcerated, (starting from zero as a prisoner). If you take this claim twice, you’ll have 4 load while you’re serving time in Ironhook. Also, you may choose to carry <span class="game-term">coin</span> in place of load for purposes of bribes or acquiring assets while in prison. You may reset the items in your prison loadout whenever your crew has downtime.</p>
