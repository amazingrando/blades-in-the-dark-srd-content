<h1>Advancement</h1>
<h2 id="pc-advancement">PC Advancement</h2>
<p>Each player keeps track of the experience points (<strong>xp</strong>) that their character earns.</p>
<p>During the game session, mark xp:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make a <strong>desperate action roll</strong>. Mark 1 xp in the attribute for the action you rolled. For example, if you roll a desperate <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> action, you mark xp in <span class="game-term">Prowess</span><em>.</em> When you roll in a <strong>group action</strong> that’s desperate, you also mark xp.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the session, review the <strong>xp triggers</strong> on your character sheet. For each one, mark 1 xp if it happened at all, or mark 2 xp if it happened a lot during the session. The xp triggers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your playbook-specific xp trigger</strong>. For example, the Cutter’s is <em>“Address a challenge with violence or coercion.”</em> To “address a challenge,” your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn’t matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.</li>
<li><strong>You expressed your beliefs, drives, heritage, or background.</strong> Your character’s beliefs and drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.</li>
<li><strong>You struggled with issues from your vice or traumas</strong>. Mark xp for this if your vice tempted you to some bad action or if a trauma condition caused you trouble. Simply indulging your vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you <strong>overindulge</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You may mark end-of-session xp on any xp tracks you want (any attribute or your playbook xp track).</p>
<p>When you fill an xp track, clear all the marks and take an <strong>advance</strong>. When you take an advance from your playbook track, you may choose an additional <strong>special ability</strong>. When you take an advance from an attribute, you may add an <strong>additional action dot</strong> to one of the actions under that attribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nadja is playing a Hound. At the end of the session, she reviews her xp triggers and tells the group how much xp she’s getting. She rolled two desperate <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> actions during the session, so she marked 2 xp on her <span class="game-term">Insight</span> xp track. She addressed several challenges with tracking or violence, so she marks 2 xp for that. She expressed her Iruvian heritage many times when dealing with the Red Sashes, so she takes 2 xp for that. She also showcased her character’s beliefs, but 2 xp is the maximum for that category, so she doesn’t get any more. She didn’t struggle with her vice or traumas, so no xp there. That’s 4 xp at the end of the session. She decides to put it all in her <span class="game-term">Insight</span> xp track. This fills the track, so she adds a new action dot in <span class="game-term">Hunt</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also earn xp by <strong>training</strong> during downtime. When you train, mark xp in one of your attributes or in your playbook. A given xp track can be trained only once per downtime phase.</p>
<h2 id="crew-advancement">Crew Advancement</h2>
<p>At the end of the session, review the crew xp triggers and mark 1 crew xp for each item that occurred during the session. If an item occurred multiple times or in a major way, mark 2 crew xp for it. The crew xp triggers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your crew-specific xp trigger</strong>. For example, the Smugglers’ is <em>“Execute a smuggling operation or acquire new clients or contraband sources.”</em> If the crew successfully completed an operation from this trigger, mark xp.</li>
<li><strong>Contend with challenges above your current station.</strong> If you tangled with higher Tiers or more dangerous opposition, mark xp for this.</li>
<li><strong>Bolster your crew’s reputation or develop a new one.</strong> Review your crew’s reputation. Did you do anything to promote it? Also mark xp if you developed a new reputation for the crew.</li>
<li><strong>Express the goals, drives, inner conflict, or essential nature of the crew.</strong> This one is very broad! Essentially, did anything happen that highlighted the specific elements that make your crew unique?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When you fill your crew advancement tracker</strong>, clear the marks and take a new <strong>special ability </strong>or mark <strong>two crew upgrade boxes</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, when a crew of Assassins earns a crew advance, they could take a new special ability, like <strong>Predators</strong>. Or they could mark two upgrades, like <strong>Ironhook Contacts</strong> and <strong>Resolve</strong> <strong>Training</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say how you’ve obtained this new ability or upgrades for the crew. <em>Where did it come from? How does it become a new part of the crew?</em></p>
<h3 id="profits">Profits</h3>
<p>Every time the crew advances, <strong>each PC gets</strong> <strong>s</strong>tash** equal to the crew Tier+2, to represent profits generated by the crew as they’ve been operating.</p>
