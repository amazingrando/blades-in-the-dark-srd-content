<h2 id="stress-relief">Stress Relief</h2>
<p>Your characters are a special lot. They defy the powers-that-be and dare to prey on those who are considered to be their betters. They push themselves further than ordinary people are willing to go. But this comes at a cost. Their life is one of constant stress. Inevitably, each turns to the seduction of a <strong>vice</strong> in order to cope.</p>
<p>A character’s vice is their obsession. But with this indulgence comes relief from stress and the ability to once again face the overwhelming challenge of their daring life.</p>
<h2 id="indulging-your-vice">Indulging Your Vice</h2>
<p>When you indulge your vice, you clear some stress from your character’s stress track. Say how your character indulges their vice, including which <strong>purveyor of vice</strong> they use to satisfy their needs.  This indulgence takes time, so it can only be done when the crew has <strong>downtime</strong>. Alternately, you may choose to release your character to be “lost in their vice” during a game session, allowing them to indulge off-camera while you play a different PC. A gang member, friend, or contact of the crew might be created as an alternate character to play, thus fleshing out the landscape of PCs.</p>
<p>You roll to find out how much stress relief your character receives. A vice roll is like a resistance roll in reverse—rather than gaining stress levels, you clear stress levels. The effectiveness of your indulgence depends upon your character’s worst attribute rating. It’s their weakest quality (<span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, or <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>) that is most in thrall to vice.</p>
<p>Make an <strong>attribute roll</strong> using your character’s lowest attribute rating (if there’s a tie, that’s fine—simply use that rating). <strong>Clear stress equal to the highest die result.</strong></p>
<h3 id="overindulgence">Overindulgence</h3>
<p>If your vice roll clears more stress levels than you had marked, you <span class="CharOverride-23">overindulge</span>. A vice is not a reliable, controllable habit. It’s a risk—and one that can drive your character to act against their own best interests.</p>
<p>When you overindulge, you make a bad call because of your vice—in acquiring it or while under its influence. To bring the effect of this bad decision into the game, select an overindulgence from the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Attract Trouble.</span> Select or roll an additional <strong>entanglement</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Brag</span> about your exploits. <strong>+2</strong> <span class="game-term">heat</span>.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Lost.</span> Your character vanishes for a few weeks. Play a different character until this one returns from their bender. When your character returns, they’ve also healed any harm they had.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Tapped.</span> Your current purveyor cuts you off. Find a new source for your vice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ignoring-your-vice">Ignoring your vice</h3>
<p>If you do not or cannot indulge your vice during a downtime phase, you take stress equal to your <span class="game-term">trauma</span>. If you don’t have any <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, you’re free to ignore your vice. It doesn’t have a hold over you (yet).</p>
<h3 id="roleplaying-amp-xp">Roleplaying &amp; XP</h3>
<p>Along with your character’s heritage and background, their vice tells us what kind of person they are. This obsession impacts their motivations, goals, and behavior. When you ponder what your character might do or say next, you can always consider their vice to help you think of something. As an added benefit, by playing to the nature of your character’s vice, you earn xp at the end of the session.</p>
<h2 id="npc-amp-faction-downtime">NPC &amp; faction downtime</h2>
<p>NPCs and factions also do things when the PCs have downtime. The GM <strong>advances their project clocks</strong> and chooses a downtime maneuver or two for each faction that they’re interested in at the moment. Choose any maneuver that makes sense for that faction to pursue. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seize a claim or increase hold, make an enemy vulnerable, or reduce the hold of a vulnerable enemy.</li>
<li>Gather information on the PCs (may be opposed by a PC roll) or another subject.</li>
<li>Achieve a short-term goal they’re in position to accomplish.</li>
<li>Acquire a new asset.</li>
<li>Call in a favor from another faction.</li>
<li>Employ political pressure or threats to force someone’s hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Choose downtime maneuvers and advance clocks for the factions you’re interested in right now. Don’t worry about the rest. Later, when you turn your attention to a faction you’ve ignored for a while, go ahead and give them several downtime phases and project clock ticks to “catch up” to current events.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure how far to progress a faction’s clock, make a fortune roll using their Tier as the base trait, modified up or down depending on the opposition or circumstances. Tick 1 segment for a 1-3 result, 2 segments for a 4/5 result, 3 segments for a 6 result, or 5 segments for a <span class="game-term">critical</span> result.</p>
<p>When factions do things that are known in the criminal underworld, <strong>tell the players about it</strong> through one of their <strong>friends</strong> or <strong>contacts</strong> or <strong>vice purveyors</strong>. These rumors and bits of gossip can lead to future scores and opportunities for the PCs.</p>
