<h1>Coin and Stash</h1>
<h2 id="coin">Coin</h2>
<p><span class="game-term">Coin</span> is an abstract measure of cash and liquid assets.</p>
<p>The few bits PCs use in their daily lives are not tracked. If a character wants to spend to achieve a small goal (bribe a doorman), use the PC’s <strong>lifestyle quality</strong> for a fortune roll.</p>
<h2 id="monetary-values">Monetary values</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">1 coin: </span>A full purse of silver pieces. A week’s wages.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">2 coin:</span> A fine weapon. A weekly income for a small business. A fine piece of art. A set of luxury clothes.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">4 coin:</span> A satchel full of silver. A month’s wages.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">6 coin:</span> An exquisite jewel. A heavy burden of silver pieces.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">8 coin:</span> A good monthly take for a small business. A small safe full of coins and valuables. A very rare luxury commodity.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">10 coin:</span> Liquidating a significant asset—a carriage and goats, a horse, a deed to a small property.</li>
</ul>
<p>More than 4<span class="game-term">coin</span> is an impractical amount to keep lying around. You must spend the excess or put it in your <strong>stash</strong> (see below). A crew can also store 4<span class="game-term CharOverride-5"> </span><span class="game-term">coin</span> in their lair, by default. If they upgrade to a <strong>vault</strong>, they can expand their stores to <span class="game-term CharOverride-15">8</span> and then 16 <span class="game-term">coin</span>. Any <span class="game-term">coin</span> beyond their limit must be spent as soon as possible (typically before the next score) or distributed among the crew members.</p>
<p>One unit of <span class="game-term">coin</span> in silver pieces or other bulk currency takes up one item slot for your <strong>load</strong> when carried.</p>
<h3 id="coin-use">Coin Use</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spend 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span> to get an additional <strong>activity</strong> during <strong>downtime</strong>.</li>
<li>Spend 1 <span class="game-term">coin</span> to increase the result level of a <strong>downtime activity</strong> roll.</li>
<li>Spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> to avoid certain crew <strong>entanglements</strong>.</li>
<li>Put <span class="game-term">coin</span> in your character’s <strong>stash</strong> to improve their lifestyle and circumstances when they retire. See the next page.</li>
<li>Spend <span class="game-term">coin</span> when you advance your crew’s <strong>Tier</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stash-amp-retirement">Stash &amp; Retirement</h2>
<p>When you mark your character’s final <span class="game-term">trauma</span> and they retire, the amount of <span class="game-term">coin</span> they’ve managed to stash away determines their fate. Your stash tracker is on your character sheet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stash 0-10:</strong> <strong>Poor soul. </strong>You end up in the gutter, awash in vice and misery.</li>
<li><strong>Stash 11-20: Meager.</strong> A tiny hovel that you can call your own.</li>
<li><strong>Stash 21-39: Modest.</strong> A simple home or apartment, with some small comforts. You might operate a tavern or small business.</li>
<li><strong>Stash 40: Fine.</strong> A well-appointed home or apartment, claiming a few luxuries. You might operate a medium business.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, each full row of stash (10 <span class="game-term">coins</span>) indicates the <strong>quality level of the character’s lifestyle</strong>, from zero (street life) to four (luxury).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cross wants some alone-time with a prospective new friend, but he can’t take them back to the hidden lair where he lives, so what to do? Ryan, Cross’s player, says he wants to rent a nice room for the evening, so the GM asks for a fortune roll using Cross’s lifestyle rating to see what quality of room Cross can manage.</p>

<h3 id="removing-coin-from-your-stash">Removing coin from your stash</h3>
<p>If you want to pull <span class="game-term">coin</span> out of your stash, you may do so, at a cost. Your character sells off some of their assets and investments in order to get some quick cash. <strong>For every 2 stash removed, you get 1 </strong><span class="game-term">coin</span><strong> in cash.</strong></p>
